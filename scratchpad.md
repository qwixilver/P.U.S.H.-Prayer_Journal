Some notes on what I want to do:

1. I want to be able to click on a request from the 'daily' tab, and have it open in the 'single' view, or alternatively expand the card to view it right there in the 'daily' tab
*. I want an 'event' log system with the requests. Each request should be able to add an event from either the single view, or the expanded view on the daily tab (depending on how we implement this). This event log will allow users to record events as they happen regarding requests. This allows events to be listed in chronological order in the prayer request so that we have a timeline as the requests are being answered that will help us look back to see how God moved in particular situations...
*. I want to collapse the 'add prayer' form that is dominating the 'daily prayers' page. it should move to a floating button in the lower right corner of the page and when tapped, the form should expand and be pinned to the top of the page until minimized by either adding a prayer or canceling the request to add a new prayer, at which time it should minimize to the floating button again.
*. Multi-line support needs to be added to the 'single' view description field. Presently it doesn't seem to respect multiple lines added to the description
