Some notes on what I want to do:

### UI updates

1. Update the first run system to mask various areas of the interface to make it more clear how to follow the instructions on the slide
1. Add icons/screenshots/short video to the slides for even more clarity on how to use the app

### Feature updates

1. I want the security view to be enhanced. I want to be able to select which individual components of prayers can/should be shown when on the security view. Each event should also be able to be locked out in the security view as needed.

1. I want to make it possible to encrypt either the entire database, or just a single entry. This should also apply to the JSON backup output - single encrypted entries should still honor a JSON structure, but the content of those entries should be encrypted individually.

1. I want a way to backup to my favorite cloud services automatically. This is a privacy first system, but it's always good to be able to make backups! This of course would be optional, and would provide a simple way for users to have access to their data across devices.

1. Answered status prayer requests should be grouped outside of the requested status prayers. There should be a toggle switch at the top right of the 'daily' tab that allows users to switch between requested and answered prayers. Answered prayers should never show in the 'single' view list. 
### Bugs
