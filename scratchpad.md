Some notes on what I want to do:

### UI updates

1. Functionality for v1.0 is good, but it needs some instructional enhancements. No functional code changes, just help for users to understand how to interact with the interface, what is available, etc. Perhaps some kind of 'first run' tutorial system in a popup would be useful here, so that it continues to feel like a mobile app.

### Feature updates

1. I want the security view to be enhanced. I want to be able to select which individual components of prayers can/should be shown when on the security view. Each event should also be able to be locked out in the security view as needed.

1. I want to make it possible to encrypt either the entire database, or just a single entry. This should also apply to the JSON backup output - single encrypted entries should still honor a JSON structure, but the content of those entries should be encrypted individually.

1. I want a way to backup to my favorite cloud services automatically. This is a privacy first system, but it's always good to be able to make backups, and if I want to use the system on 

1. Answered prayer requests should be grouped outside of the normal requested status prayers. There should be a toggle switch at the top right of the 'daily' tab that allows users to switch between requested and answered prayers. Answered prayers should never show in the 'single' view list.

1. I want a notifications system that will alert on a user defined schedule. The schedule should be something the user can set in the 'settings' page.
